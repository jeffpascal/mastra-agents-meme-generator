# Tawk.to Webhook Integration for Mastra Agents

This document provides a complete guide for setting up a Tawk.to webhook that integrates with Mastra agents for intelligent chat responses and meme generation.

## üéØ Overview

The Tawk.to webhook enables automated responses to live chat events, allowing your agents to:

- Process chat messages with the meme generator agent
- Handle support tickets with the availability agent
- Provide personalized responses with memory integration
- Process chat transcripts for analytics
- Respond to various chat lifecycle events

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up the webhook, ensure you have:

- **Tawk.to Account**: A tawk.to account with admin access
- **Property Setup**: At least one property configured in tawk.to
- **Webhook Endpoint**: A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint
- **Mastra Setup**: Working Mastra environment with agents configured
- **API Credentials**: OpenAI and Mem0 API keys

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Tawk.to Webhook Configuration (required)
TAWK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
WEBHOOK_PORT=3001

# OpenAI Configuration (required for AI responses)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Mem0 Configuration (required for memory features)
MEM0_API_KEY=your_mem0_api_key_here

# Optional: Imgflip credentials for meme generation
IMGFLIP_USERNAME=your_imgflip_username
IMGFLIP_PASSWORD=your_imgflip_password
```

### 3. Getting Your Webhook Secret

#### Step 1: Access Tawk.to Dashboard
1. Log in to your [tawk.to dashboard](https://dashboard.tawk.to/)
2. Select your property
3. Go to **Administration** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**

#### Step 2: Create Webhook
1. Click **Create Webhook**
2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Mastra Agent Integration")
3. Set the endpoint URL to: `https://your-domain.com/webhook`
4. Select the events you want to handle:
   - ‚úÖ **Chat Start** - For processing new chat messages
   - ‚úÖ **Chat End** - For cleanup and analytics
   - ‚úÖ **New Chat Transcript** - For full conversation analysis
   - ‚úÖ **New Ticket** - For support ticket handling
5. Generate or set a **Secret Key** - this becomes your `TAWK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
6. Save the webhook configuration

### 4. Start the Webhook Server

```bash
# Install dependencies if not already done
npm install

# Start the webhook server
npm run webhook
```

The server will start on port 3001 and display:

```
üöÄ Tawk.to Webhook Server running on port 3001
üí¨ Webhook URL: http://localhost:3001/webhook
üí¨ Alternative URL: http://localhost:3001/webhooks/tawk
üîç Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Server info: http://localhost:3001/
```

## üîß Webhook Events

The webhook handles four main types of events from tawk.to:

### 1. Chat Start Event

Triggered when a visitor sends the first message in a chat.

**Example payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "chat:start",
  "chatId": "70fe3290-99ad-11e9-a30a-51567162179f",
  "time": "2024-01-15T14:03:04.646Z",
  "message": {
    "text": "I need help creating a meme",
    "type": "msg",
    "sender": {
      "type": "visitor"
    }
  },
  "visitor": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "property": {
    "id": "58ca8453b8a7e060cd3b1ecb",
    "name": "My Website"
  }
}
```

**Processing:** The meme generator agent processes visitor messages and generates appropriate responses.

### 2. Chat End Event

Triggered when a chat session ends.

**Processing:** Used for cleanup and analytics. No direct response generated.

### 3. Chat Transcript Created Event

Triggered after a complete chat session with full message history.

**Processing:** Can be used for conversation analysis and follow-up actions.

### 4. Ticket Created Event

Triggered when a new support ticket is created.

**Example payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "ticket:create",
  "time": "2024-01-15T14:07:13.512Z",
  "property": {
    "id": "58ca8453b8a7e060cd3b1ecb",
    "name": "My Website"
  },
  "requester": {
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  },
  "ticket": {
    "id": "02598050-99ae-11e9-8887-97564881b95b",
    "humanId": 3,
    "subject": "Need help with availability",
    "message": "I can't find available dates for booking"
  }
}
```

**Processing:** The availability agent processes tickets and generates helpful responses.

## ü§ñ Agent Integration

### Meme Generator Agent

Processes chat messages to create meme-related responses:

```typescript
// Example processing
const agent = mastra.getAgent('memeGenerator');
const response = await agent.generate([
  { role: 'user', content: '[Chat message from John Doe] I need help creating a meme' }
]);
```

### Availability Agent

Handles support tickets and availability-related queries:

```typescript
// Example processing
const agent = mastra.getAgent('availability');
const response = await agent.generate([
  { role: 'user', content: '[Support ticket from Jane Smith] Need help with availability' }
]);
```

## üîí Security

### Webhook Signature Verification

All webhook requests are verified using HMAC-SHA1 signatures:

```typescript
function verifyTawkSignature(body: string, signature: string): boolean {
  const digest = crypto
    .createHmac('sha1', WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(body)
    .digest('hex');
  return signature === digest;
}
```

### Headers

- `X-Tawk-Signature`: HMAC-SHA1 signature of the request body
- `X-Hook-Event-Id`: Unique event identifier (consistent across retries)

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Checks

Monitor webhook health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "service": "Tawk.to Webhook for Mastra Agents",
  "environment": "development",
  "supportedEvents": [
    "chat:start",
    "chat:end",
    "chat:transcript_created",
    "ticket:create"
  ],
  "signatureVerification": true
}
```

### Logging

The webhook provides detailed logging:

```
üí¨ Processing chat message from John Doe (70fe3290-99ad-11e9-a30a-51567162179f): "I need help creating a meme"
ü§ñ Agent response generated: Here's how you can create a funny meme...
üé´ Processing ticket creation from Jane Smith: "Need help with availability"
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Use the included Docker configuration:

```bash
# Production
make run-all              # Start both main app and webhook
make logs-webhook         # Monitor webhook logs

# Development
make run-all-dev          # Start with hot reload
make logs-webhook-dev     # Monitor development logs
```

### Environment Setup

1. **Set up your `.env` file** with the required variables
2. **Configure your webhook URL** in tawk.to dashboard
3. **Test the webhook** using tawk.to's test feature

### HTTPS Requirements

Tawk.to requires HTTPS for webhook endpoints. For production:

- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) with SSL certificates
- Deploy to platforms that provide HTTPS (Heroku, Vercel, AWS)
- Use ngrok for local testing: `ngrok http 3001`

## üîß Configuration

### Webhook URL Format

Your webhook URL should be accessible at:
- Primary: `https://your-domain.com/webhook`
- Alternative: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/tawk`

### Retry Policy

Tawk.to will retry failed webhook calls:
- Up to 12 hours of retries
- 30-second timeout per request
- Same event ID across retries

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding Custom Agents

To integrate additional agents:

```typescript
// In processChatMessage function
const customAgent = mastra.getAgent('yourCustomAgent');
const response = await customAgent.generate([
  { role: 'user', content: contextualMessage }
]);
```

### Custom Event Processing

Add custom logic for specific events:

```typescript
switch (webhookData.event) {
  case 'chat:start':
    // Your custom chat start logic
    break;
  case 'ticket:create':
    // Your custom ticket handling
    break;
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Signature verification fails**
```
‚ùå Tawk.to webhook signature verification failed
```
**Solution:** Ensure `TAWK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the secret key in your tawk.to webhook configuration.

**2. Agent not found**
```
‚ùå Meme generator agent not found
```
**Solution:** Verify your agents are properly configured in `src/mastra/index.ts`.

**3. Webhook not receiving events**
- Check that your webhook URL is publicly accessible via HTTPS
- Verify the webhook is properly configured in tawk.to dashboard
- Test with ngrok for local development

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

This provides verbose logging for debugging webhook events and agent responses.

## ü§ù Integration Examples

### Basic Chat Response

When a visitor sends: "I want to create a funny meme about work"

The system processes this through the meme generator agent and could respond with:
"I'd love to help you create a work meme! Let me guide you through some popular work meme formats..."

### Support Ticket Processing

When a ticket is created with subject "Booking availability":

The availability agent processes the ticket and generates appropriate follow-up actions or responses.
