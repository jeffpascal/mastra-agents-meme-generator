# WhatsApp Business API Webhook for Mastra Availability Agent

This document provides a complete guide for setting up a WhatsApp Business API webhook that integrates with the Mastra availability agent for property booking and management.

## üéØ Overview

The WhatsApp webhook enables users to interact with the availability agent via WhatsApp messages, allowing them to:

- Check property availability for specific dates
- Get information about available properties
- Create booking links
- Receive personalized responses with memory integration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up the webhook, ensure you have:

- **WhatsApp Business Account**: A verified WhatsApp Business Account through Meta for Developers
- **Meta App**: A Business app in the Meta App Dashboard with WhatsApp Product added
- **Phone Number**: A WhatsApp Business phone number registered with Meta
- **API Credentials**: Access token and phone number ID from Meta
- **Mastra Setup**: Working Mastra environment with the availability agent
- **MCP Server**: Running MCP server for property data (if using external services)

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# WhatsApp Business API Configuration
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_whatsapp_access_token_here
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id_here
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_custom_verify_token_here
WEBHOOK_PORT=3001

# OpenAI Configuration (required for AI responses)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Mem0 Configuration (required for memory features)
MEM0_API_KEY=your_mem0_api_key_here
```

### 3. Getting WhatsApp API Credentials

#### Step 1: Create Meta App
1. Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Create a new Business App
3. Add the WhatsApp Product to your app

#### Step 2: Get Access Token
1. In your Meta App Dashboard, go to WhatsApp ‚Üí Getting Started
2. Copy the temporary access token (for testing) or generate a permanent one
3. Set this as `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`

#### Step 3: Get Phone Number ID
1. In WhatsApp ‚Üí Getting Started, find your test phone number
2. Copy the Phone Number ID
3. Set this as `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`

#### Step 4: Set Verify Token
1. Choose a custom verification token (keep it secret!)
2. Set this as `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`

### 4. Start the Webhook Server

```bash
# Install dependencies if not already done
npm install

# Start the webhook server
npm run webhook:whatsapp
```

The server will start on port 3001 (or your configured `WEBHOOK_PORT`) and display:

```
üöÄ WhatsApp Webhook Server running on port 3001
üì± WhatsApp webhook URL: http://localhost:3001/webhooks/whatsapp
üîç Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Server info: http://localhost:3001/
```

## üîß Webhook Configuration in Meta

### 1. Configure Webhook URL

1. In your Meta App Dashboard, go to WhatsApp ‚Üí Configuration
2. Set the webhook URL to: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/whatsapp`
   - For local testing with ngrok: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhooks/whatsapp`
3. Set the verify token to match your `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`
4. Subscribe to the `messages` field

### 2. Webhook Fields

Subscribe to these webhook fields:
- ‚úÖ **messages** - Required for receiving user messages

### 3. Local Development with ngrok

For local testing, use ngrok to expose your local server:

```bash
# Install ngrok if not already installed
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose local port 3001
ngrok http 3001
```

Use the generated ngrok URL as your webhook URL in Meta Dashboard.

## üì± Usage Examples

Once configured, users can interact with your WhatsApp Business number:

### Basic Availability Queries

**User**: "Hello, I need a place to stay"  
**Agent**: "Hello! I'd be happy to help you find accommodation. üè® To get started, could you let me know:
- What dates are you looking for?
- How many guests?
- Any specific property preferences?"

**User**: "I need accommodation from June 15 to June 20 for 2 people"  
**Agent**: "Perfect! Let me check availability for June 15-20 for 2 guests. üîç"

*[Agent searches available properties and responds with options]*

### Property-Specific Queries

**User**: "Is Casa Pescarului available next month?"  
**Agent**: "Let me check Casa Pescarului availability for next month... üè°"

*[Agent checks specific property and responds with availability]*

### Booking Creation

**User**: "I want to book Casa Pescarului from July 10 to July 15"  
**Agent**: "Great choice! Casa Pescarului is available July 10-15. Here's your booking link: [booking_url] üéâ"

## üß† Memory Integration

The webhook integrates with both Mastra's built-in memory and Mem0 for intelligent conversations:

### Automatic Memory (Mastra)
- Tracks conversation context automatically
- Remembers user preferences within the session
- Maintains conversation flow seamlessly

### Explicit Memory (Mem0)
- Stores user preferences across sessions
- Remembers successful booking patterns
- Learns from user interactions

### Example Memory Usage

**First interaction:**
**User**: "I'm looking for a romantic getaway for 2 people"  
**Agent**: *[Provides recommendations and saves preference for romantic properties]*

**Later interaction:**
**User**: "Do you have anything available?"  
**Agent**: "Based on your preference for romantic getaways, I'd recommend checking Casa Pescariului or Vila Franceza. What dates are you thinking? üíï"

```

### Key Components

1. **WhatsApp Webhook Handler** (`src/mastra/webhooks/whatsapp.ts`)
   - Verifies webhook requests from Meta
   - Processes incoming messages
   - Sends responses via WhatsApp API

2. **Express Server** (`src/mastra/webhooks/server.ts`)
   - Serves webhook endpoints
   - Handles HTTPS requirements
   - Provides health checks

3. **Availability Agent** (`src/mastra/agents/availability-agent.ts`)
   - Processes user queries
   - Integrates with property systems
   - Manages memory and context

4. **MCP Tools** (`src/mastra/tools/availability.ts`)
   - Interfaces with property management systems
   - Provides availability data
   - Creates booking links

## üîí Security Considerations

### Webhook Verification
- Always verify webhook requests using the verify token
- Validate payload structure with Zod schemas
- Use HTTPS for all webhook communications

### API Security
- Keep WhatsApp access tokens secure and rotate regularly
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting if needed

### Data Privacy
- Follow WhatsApp Business API policies
- Respect user privacy and data protection laws
- Don't store sensitive user data unnecessarily

## üö® Error Handling

The webhook includes comprehensive error handling:

### Message Processing Errors
- Invalid webhook payloads are rejected gracefully
- Agent failures result in helpful error messages
- API failures include fallback contact information

### Retry Logic
- WhatsApp automatically retries failed webhooks for up to 7 days
- Webhook acknowledges receipt immediately to prevent duplicates
- Failed message sends are logged for debugging

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Webhook Verification Fails
```
‚ùå WhatsApp webhook verification failed
```
**Solution**: Check that `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` matches the token set in Meta Dashboard

#### Agent Not Found
```
‚ùå Availability agent not found
```
**Solution**: Ensure the availability agent is properly configured in `src/mastra/index.ts`

#### WhatsApp API Errors
```
‚ùå WhatsApp API error: 401 Unauthorized
```
**Solution**: Check that `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` is valid and has necessary permissions

#### MCP Connection Issues
```
‚ùå Error calling MCP tool
```
**Solution**: Ensure your MCP server is running and accessible
