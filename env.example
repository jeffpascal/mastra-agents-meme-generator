# Note: Some features work without API keys:
# - Frustration extraction (uses OpenAI but can be mocked)
# - Meme template search (Imgflip API works without auth for basic features)
# - Meme generation (Imgflip provides stable URLs without additional hosting)
#
# For the full experience, you'll need at least the OpenAI API key.
