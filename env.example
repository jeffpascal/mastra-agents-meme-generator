# OpenAI Configuration (required for image generation)

# Mem0 Configuration (required for intelligent memory)

# Optional: Imgflip credentials for advanced meme template features

# Note: Some features work without API keys:
# - Frustration extraction (uses OpenAI but can be mocked)
# - Meme template search (Imgflip API works without auth for basic features)
# - Meme generation (Imgflip provides stable URLs without additional hosting)
#
# For the full experience, you'll need at least the OpenAI API key and Mem0 API key.
# For Tawk.to integration, you'll need to set up a webhook in your tawk.to dashboard
# and configure the TAWK_WEBHOOK_SECRET to match your webhook secret key.
