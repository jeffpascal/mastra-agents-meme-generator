# Note: Some features work without API keys:
# - Frustration extraction (uses OpenAI but can be mocked)
# - Meme template search (Imgflip API works without auth for basic features)
# - Meme generation (Imgflip provides stable URLs without additional hosting)
#
# For the full experience, you'll need at least the OpenAI API key and Mem0 API key.
# For WhatsApp integration, you'll need all the WHATSAPP_* variables from Meta for Developers.
